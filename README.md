# Guessing Languages Words
Unity 2D game - C#

This game is a mix of my desire to improve my languages knowledsge, 
and also my curiosity to Succeed in Anagram challenges.
My refernce was Scrubbles game which I used to play a lot when I was a kid.
I wrote 4 levels in different languages.
Each level contains 7 words, so in total there are 28 options.
There is a randomization on the 7 words and I added ASCII drawings for the levels reward.
So go ahead and test your knowledge in different languages ;)
